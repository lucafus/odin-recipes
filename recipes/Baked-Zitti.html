<h2> Description </h2>

<p>This baked ziti is always a hit! A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and everyone loved it. 
    Now it is the favorite of all my dinner guests. 
    I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.</p> 


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">

<li>1 pound dry ziti pasta</li>
<li>1 onion, chopped</li>
<li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
<li>2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
<li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>
<li>1 Â½ cups sour cream</li>
<li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>

<h2>How to Make a Baked Zitti</h2>

<ol style="list-style-type:square;">

    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.  </li>

        and remaining meat sauce. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.   </li>
